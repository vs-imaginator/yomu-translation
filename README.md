# yomu-translation
>Yomu is the Japanese transitive word meaning "to read"

Final project for Tec 378
* This is a proof-of-concept for an imaginary business we designed. I conducted a market analysis of similar services (in early 2020) and created a competitive translation service. There are obviously many parts which could have been fleshed out better, but like I said, this is a proof-of-concept.
