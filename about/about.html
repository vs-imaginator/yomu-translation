            <p>"読む" (yomu) is the Japanese word that means "to read." Here at YOMU translation services we strive to make reading as simple as possible, even with language barriers. As professionals, we understand the importance of overseas relations especially in an increasingly global market. The ability to communicate with foreign businesses only opens a myriad of options that will increase the strength of your business. This is why we want to provide a hastle-free translation service to you. Whether it be e-mails, webpages or meeting transcripts, we will be here for you!</p>
            
            <p>Yomu Translation Services originally started as Matthew’s personal project to translate Japanese books and magazines to English for friends. However, he soon realized he could help countless more people with his skills by starting a company to translate important documents. After starting the company, he brought on colleagues Hana and Mike to get the company off the ground.</p>
            
            <p>Yomu is currently a small company aiming to help other small businesses conduct business abroad to compete on a global scale. Many small businesses might not have the assets to translate many languages, but that is when we can help! <b>We translate, you do business.</b></p>
