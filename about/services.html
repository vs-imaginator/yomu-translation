        <!-- main text area -->  
            <p>YOMU also is offering an industry-leading service to <b>localize websites</b> and other interactive web-based programs. The internet provides an incredibly opportunity for global business so we would like to offer professional website translations. This is part of our translate the web initiative. With members of our staff being experiences web developers, we can provide translated websites to help your business open its doors to new markets across the world!</p>   
            <p>At Yomu, we strive to provide an affordable “on-demand” translation service to be ready whenever you are. Currently we are offering English to Spanish, Japanese, Chinese or Korean but intend to expand soon. We believe that language barriers should not hinder business but instead be a gate for new opportunities!</p>               
            <p>Our professional in-house translators have passed rigorous examinations and tests of skill in order to ensure that they are ready to provide the best service possible. Many of our translators we staff have various qualifications or certifications in their languages of expertise and many know multiple languages and help to ensure guaranteed satisfaction. Additionally, all of our translators have backgrounds in other professions which give them a better understanding of how to approach each translation with the final product in mind. More information about our translators can be found on <a href="team.html">our team page.</a></p>

            <h2>Translation Levels</h2>      
            <p>We offer three different tiers of translation options for various professional needs. Since each tier calls for different skillsets depending on the material being translated, pricing options vary. Here is a breakdown of each tier, pricing estimates can be found on our <a href="quote.html">quote calculator page.</a></p><br>
            
            <h3><a id="standard">Standard</a></h3>
            <p>This level is intended for personal use. Standard translations entail the expected level of quality that Yomu provides but assumes that the material being translated does not require special formatting, no technical vocabulary, or coding required. Examples of materials that would fall into this category would be personal emails, phone/audio messages, flyers or books.</p>
            <p>These translations start at $0.07 per word but may be more depending on special instructions or requests. A proper estimate would be able to provide before we begin translations. For additional pricing questions see out <a href="contact.html">contact page.</a></p>
            
            <h3><a id="business">Business</a></h3>
            <p>This level is intended for business documents. These translations might require special knowledge in international business customs of a particular country such as polite greetings. These translators will be well-versed in international business so you will be able to expect professional translations. Examples of materials that would fall into this category would be professional emails, phone transcripts and contracts.</p>
            <p>These translations start at $0.10 per word but may be more depending on special instructions or requests. A proper estimate would be able to provide before we begin translations. For additional pricing questions see out <a href="contact.html">contact page.</a></p>
            
            <h3><a id="technical">Technical</a></h3>
            <p>This level is intended for technical documents. These translations might require special knowledge in technical fields ranging from engineering to law. These translators will be well-versed in these professions and many currently work in the industry. Examples of materials that would fall into this category would be technical papers, website translations, user guides or manuals.</p>
            <p>These translations start at $0.15 per word but may be more depending on special instructions or requests. A proper estimate would be able to provide before we begin translations. For additional pricing questions see out <a href="contact.html">contact page.</a></p>

            <h2><a id="quality">Quality Assurance</a></h2>
            <p>At Yomu our goal is to provide industry-leading translations with customer satisfaction in mind. We understand that important business transactions might be dependent on these materials so we want to give you peace-of-mind knowing that these translations will be of expected quality.</p>
            <p>All of our translations are closely monitored with a system to ensure minor issues during translation. These include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Spellcheck</li>
                <li>Number accuracy</li>
                <li>Code Checking</li>
                <li>Machine translation review</li>
            </ul>    
            <p>We offer an optional “Peer Reviewed” option before submitting a translation request. This will charge an extra 20% per word for a proofreader also at the same level as the translator. We recommend this option for documents that are not time-sensitive since additional review will require additional time.</p>
